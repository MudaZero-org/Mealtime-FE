# Introduction  
[Mealtime](https://mealtime-web.com) gives businesses the ability to generate ready-to-cook meal packs to sell to their customers. Meal packs are a collection of the ingredients and instructions required to make a meal. The businesses can add the ingredients they have available in their stores, and then choose from our list of generated meal pack options. Businesses can use our app to increase the amount of appealing products in their store and provide convenience for their customers.

<br>
<a href="https://mealtime-web.com">Mealtime</a> uses JavaScript and React for the structure of the frontend, and Sass, Bulma, and Bootstrap for the styling. For the backend, we used Node.js, Express.js, JWT, and PostgreSQL. We also used <a href="https://spoonacular.com/food-api">Spoonacular</a> as an external api to get our meal pack data from. Finally, our backend is containerized with Docker and is deployed using AWS (ECS, Cloudfront, and S3).
